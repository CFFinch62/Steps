step: table_display
    belongs to: tui
    expects: rows as list, columns as list
    returns: nothing

    note: Display a list of tables as aligned columns
    note: columns = list of column names (keys in each row table)
    note: rows = list of tables, each table has keys matching columns
    note: Example:
    note:   set cols to ["name", "age"]
    note:   set data to []
    note:   add ["name": "Alice", "age": "30"] to data
    note:   add ["name": "Bob", "age": "25"] to data
    note:   call table_display with data, cols

    declare:
        row as table
        col as text
        value as text
        output_line as text
        header_line as text
        separator as text
        col_width as number
        padded as text

    do:
        note: Use fixed column width for simplicity
        set col_width to 15
        
        note: Build header
        set header_line to ""
        repeat for each col in columns
            call pad_text with col, col_width, "left" storing result in padded
            set header_line to header_line added to padded
        display header_line
        
        note: Build separator
        set separator to ""
        call repeat_text with "-", col_width * length of columns storing result in separator
        display separator
        
        note: Display each row
        repeat for each row in rows
            set output_line to ""
            repeat for each col in columns
                set value to row[col]
                call pad_text with value, col_width, "left" storing result in padded
                set output_line to output_line added to padded
            display output_line
