# Steps Language Quick Reference

## Basic Syntax

### Variables
```steps
set name to "Alice"
set age to 25
set score to 98.5
set active to true
set items to [1, 2, 3]
set person to ["name": "Bob", "age": 30]
```

### Display & Input
```steps
display "Hello, World!"                      # Output with newline
indicate "Loading..."                        # Output without newline
display "Your score: " added to (score as text)
set name to input
set age to input as number
```

### Operators
```steps
# Arithmetic: +  -  *  /
set total to price * quantity

# Comparison
if age is greater than 18
if name equals "Alice"
if score is less than or equal to 100

# Boolean: and  or  not
if age is greater than 18 and has_license
```

## Control Flow

### If Statements
```steps
if condition
    statements

if condition
    statements
otherwise
    statements

if condition1
    statements
otherwise if condition2
    statements
otherwise
    statements
```

### Loops
```steps
# Repeat N times
repeat 10 times
    display "Hello"

# For each item
repeat for each item in my_list
    display item

# While loop
repeat while count is less than 10
    set count to count + 1

# Set iteration limit (default: 10,000,000)
set iteration limit to 100000
```

## Data Types

### Lists
```steps
set numbers to [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
set first to numbers[0]
add 6 to numbers
remove 3 from numbers
set len to length of numbers
if 5 is in numbers
    display "Found it"
```

### Tables (Dictionaries)
```steps
set person to ["name": "Alice", "age": 25]
set name to person["name"]
set person["city"] to "Boston"
```

### Text Operations
```steps
set greeting to "Hello, " added to name
set len to length of "hello"
set first_char to character at 0 of "hello"
if "hello" contains "ell"
if "hello" starts with "he"
if "hello" ends with "lo"
set words to "a,b,c" split by ","
```

## Program Structure

### Building (Entry Point)
```steps
building: project_name
    note: Optional description

    statements
    exit
```

### Floor Definition
```steps
floor: my_floor
    step: step_one
    step: step_two
```

### Step Definition
```steps
step: calculate_total
    belongs to: my_floor
    expects: price, quantity
    returns: total
    
    declare:
        tax as number
    
    do:
        set tax to price * 0.1
        set total to (price * quantity) + tax
        return total
```

### Calling Steps
```steps
call my_step
call my_step with arg1, arg2
call my_step storing result in result_var
call my_step with arg1, arg2 storing result in result_var
```

### Risers (Helper Functions)
```steps
step: parent_step
    expects: value
    returns: result
    
    riser: helper
        expects: input
        returns: output
        do:
            set output to input * 2
            return output
    
    do:
        call helper with value storing result in doubled
        return doubled
```

## Error Handling

```steps
attempt:
    set num to input as number
    set result to 100 / num
if unsuccessful:
    display "Error: " added to problem_message
    set result to 0
then continue:
    display "Done"
```

## Console Control

```steps
# Clear the terminal screen
clear console

# Display without newline (for progress bars, etc.)
indicate "\r" added to "Progress: 50%"

# Update progress bar in place
set i to 0
repeat while i is less than or equal to 100
    call progress_bar with i, 100, 40 storing result in bar
    indicate "\r" added to "Loading: " added to bar
    set i to i + 10
display ""  # Final newline
```

## Type Conversion

```steps
set num to "42" as number
set text to 42 as text
set bool to 1 as boolean
set formatted to 3.14159 as decimal(2)  # "3.14"
```

## Type Checking

```steps
set t to type of value
if value is a number
if value is a text
if value is a boolean
if value is a list
if value is a table
```

## Comments

```steps
note: This is a single-line comment

note block:
    This is a multi-line comment.
    It can span multiple lines.
end note
```
