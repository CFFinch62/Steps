## Key Messages

### For Educators
1. **Visible Structure** - Students can literally see program organization
2. **Forced Decomposition** - No monolithic code possible
3. **English Syntax** - Lower cognitive load, focus on logic
4. **Educational Errors** - Messages that teach, not frustrate
5. **Complete Tooling** - REPL, IDE, CLI all included
6. **Ready to Teach** - Tutorial and examples included

### Value Propositions
- Teaches programming concepts without syntax overhead
- Makes abstract concepts (modularity, decomposition) tangible
- Students develop good habits from day one
- Concepts transfer to any mainstream language
- Reduces instructor time explaining cryptic errors

## Content Strategy
