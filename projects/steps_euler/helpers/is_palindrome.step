step: is_palindrome

    belongs to: helpers
    expects: value
    returns: valid
    
    declare:
        text_value as text
        valid as boolean
        len as number
        int_len as number
        count as number
        char_left as text
        char_right as text
        
    do:
        set text_value to ""
        set count to 0
    
        note: Determine the string representation based on type
        if value is a number
            set text_value to value as text
        otherwise
            if value is a text
                set text_value to value
            otherwise
                set valid to false
                return valid
          
        note: Now begin to check if text_value is a palindrome
        set len to length of text_value
        call round with (len / 2) storing result in int_len
    
        note: Handle edge case
        if len is less than or equal to 1
            set valid to true
            return valid
    
        note: Compare characters from both ends
        repeat while count is less than or equal to int_len - 1
            call slice with text_value, count, count + 1 storing result in char_left
            call slice with text_value, (int_len - 1) - count, int_len - count storing result in char_right
        
            if char_left is not equal to char_right
                set valid to false
                return valid
    
        set valid to true
        return valid
