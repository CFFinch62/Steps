step: find_triplets_by_sum
    
    belongs to: helpers
    expects: sum
    returns: triplets
    
    declare:
        max as number
        a as number
        num as number
        den as number
        b as number
        b_int as number
        c as number
        triplet as list
        
           
    do:             
        note: S/3 is the mathematical limit for 'a' because a < b < c
        note: We use a simple loop. Each 'a' is a float (e.g., 1.0, 2.0...)
        set max to sum / 3 
        set a to 1.0
        set triplets to []
        
        repeat while a is less than max
            note: b = (S^2 - 2Sa) / (2S - 2a)
            set num to (sum * sum) - (2.0 * sum * a)
            set den to (2.0 * sum) - (2.0 * a)
            
            set b to num / den
            call round with (num / den) storing result in b_int
        
            note: Check if b is an "integer" in Steps
            note: We do this by comparing b to its rounded-down version
            if b equals b_int 
                set c to sum - a - b
                set triplet to [a, b, c]
                add triplet to triplets 
        
            set a to a + 1.0
            
        return triplets
