step: lcm 

    belongs to: helpers
    expects: n1, n2
    returns: least_cm
    
    declare:
        num1 as number
        num2 as number
        tmp as number
        least as number

    do:    
        set num1 to n1
        set num2 to n2
        set tmp to 0
        
        call gcd with num1, num2 storing result in tmp
        
        set least to (num1 * num2) / tmp 
         
        return least
